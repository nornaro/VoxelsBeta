As you see there are a lot of bugs, many things not working as intended. 
I just made a quick attempt on making it compatible with this amazing asset:
	Medieval Hexagon Pack from KayKit Game Assets
I wanted to include MeshLibrary and GridMap, but had issues with correct placement
Save/load is barely working, doesn't store all data, needs to also generate Voxel save, 
placed Tiles, Objects/Buildings etc.

Thank You for watching!
